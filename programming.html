            <h2>Project Sequoia</h2>
            <p>Since very long I've been frustrated with the Dutch school system, or almost any school system for that matter. School currently is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inflexible, since teachers can only teach one thing at a time.</li>
                <li>Unpersonal, because teachers have to teach the same thing to a classroom of 20+ pupils, who all have their own learning style.</li>
                <li>Boring (no further explanation required).</li>
                <li>Very expensive, since teachers need to be paid, as well as classrooms, accesoires, books, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Teachers, classrooms, and lots of other expensive, time-consuming, inflexible things used to be a requirement for education. However, in the age of computers and information, I don't believe these are neccesary anymore. The only challenge left is to organise information in such a way, people can use it to learn and understand how the world works.</p>
            <p>Information is usually presented in a linear fashon. In other words, first you explain A, then B, then C, etcetera. However, this is not how information works. New information is mostly dependent on previous information. If you learn how multiplication works, you need to first know how addition works.</p>
            <p>Computers are very good at keeping track of these kinds of dependencies. So, the obvious solution is to make a piece of software which keeps track of the progress of every individual who uses it.</p>
